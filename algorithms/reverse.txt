# write an algorithmsn to find reverse of given


steps:  discription

1: take number as input
2: take digits counts in a variable by converting the input number into string.
3: define variable and store 0(rev = 0), rem = (0)
4: use loop up to the length stroed in step 2 to 0
5: inside loop use
 rem = input_num % 10
 rev = rem * 10 +rem
 input_num = input_num // 10

6: display rev
7: stop
