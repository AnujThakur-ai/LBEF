# You were given a tuple with elements (2, 4, 5). You want to generate a total value from the
# tuple elements. Write a Python program to unpack the tuple into several variables and display
# the total value.

# Given tuple
values = (2, 4, 5)
# Unpacking the tuple into variables

a, b, c = values

# Calculating the total value
total_value = a + b + c
# Displaying the total value
print("Total value:", total_value)
